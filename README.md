# Project Overview

## **Development**
+ Created links that send you to the corresponding page when clicked.
+ Made it so when you hover over the links it includes styles that underline in blue.
+ I input images that allow you to click on and be sent to past work projects in a new tab.
+ Included links to my personal email and GitHub account.
+ Properly structured my code in semantic form.
+ Provided clear comments in both the HTML and CSS pages.
+ Used media queries to improve user experience on any device ranging from laptop to an iphone.
+ Used flexbox properties to make the content change properly as the webpage changed accordingly.
+ Made a grayscale filter on my images.
